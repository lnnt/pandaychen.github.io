## 0x00 前言

## 0x01 重要结构

1、Channel<br>
A Channel is an ordered, reliable, flow-controlled, duplex stream that is multiplexed over an SSH connection.

```golang
type Channel interface {
	// Read reads up to len(data) bytes from the channel.
	Read(data []byte) (int, error)

	// Write writes len(data) bytes to the channel.
	Write(data []byte) (int, error)

	// Close signals end of channel use. No data may be sent after this
	// call.
	Close() error

	// CloseWrite signals the end of sending in-band
	// data. Requests may still be sent, and the other side may
	// still send data
	CloseWrite() error

	// SendRequest sends a channel request.  If wantReply is true,
	// it will wait for a reply and return the result as a
	// boolean, otherwise the return value will be false. Channel
	// requests are out-of-band messages so they may be sent even
	// if the data stream is closed or blocked by flow control.
	// If the channel is closed before a reply is returned, io.EOF
	// is returned.
	SendRequest(name string, wantReply bool, payload []byte) (bool, error)

	// Stderr returns an io.ReadWriter that writes to this channel
	// with the extended data type set to stderr. Stderr may
	// safely be read and written from a different goroutine than
	// Read and Write respectively.
	Stderr() io.ReadWriter
}
```

2、Request 和 Reply<br>
协议交互的收发包协议结构：

Request is a request sent outside of the normal stream of data. Requests can either be specific to an SSH channel, or they can be global.

```golang
type Request struct {
	Type      string
	WantReply bool
	Payload   []byte
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

<br>
Reply sends a response to a request. It must be called for all requests where WantReply is true and is a no-op otherwise. The payload argument is ignored for replies to channel-specific requests.<br>

```golang
func (r *Request) Reply(ok bool, payload []byte) error
```

3、核心结构 Session<br>
文档：[Session](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh#Session)
A Session represents a connection to a remote command or shell.

```golang
type Session struct {
	// Stdin specifies the remote process's standard input.
	// If Stdin is nil, the remote process reads from an empty
	// bytes.Buffer.
	Stdin io.Reader

	// Stdout and Stderr specify the remote process's standard
	// output and error.
	//
	// If either is nil, Run connects the corresponding file
	// descriptor to an instance of ioutil.Discard. There is a
	// fixed amount of buffering that is shared for the two streams.
	// If either blocks it may eventually cause the remote
	// command to block.
	Stdout io.Writer
	Stderr io.Writer
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

4、Conn<br>
Conn 是一个`interface{}`
Conn represents an SSH connection for both server and client roles. Conn is the basis for implementing an application layer, such as ClientConn, which implements the traditional shell access for clients.<br>

```golang
type Conn interface {
	ConnMetadata

	// SendRequest sends a global request, and returns the
	// reply. If wantReply is true, it returns the response status
	// and payload. See also RFC4254, section 4.
	SendRequest(name string, wantReply bool, payload []byte) (bool, []byte, error)

	// OpenChannel tries to open an channel. If the request is
	// rejected, it returns *OpenChannelError. On success it returns
	// the SSH Channel and a Go channel for incoming, out-of-band
	// requests. The Go channel must be serviced, or the
	// connection will hang.
	OpenChannel(name string, data []byte) (Channel, <-chan *Request, error)

	// Close closes the underlying network connection
	Close() error

	// Wait blocks until the connection has shut down, and returns the
	// error causing the shutdown.
	Wait() error
}
```

5、ConnMetadata<br>
ConnMetadata holds metadata for the connection.<br>

```golang
type ConnMetadata interface {
	// User returns the user ID for this connection.
	User() string

	// SessionID returns the session hash, also denoted by H.
	SessionID() []byte

	// ClientVersion returns the client's version string as hashed
	// into the session ID.
	ClientVersion() []byte

	// ServerVersion returns the server's version string as hashed
	// into the session ID.
	ServerVersion() []byte

	// RemoteAddr returns the remote address for this connection.
	RemoteAddr() net.Addr

	// LocalAddr returns the local address for this connection.
	LocalAddr() net.Addr
}
```

6、
ServerConn is an authenticated SSH connection, as seen from the server<br>

```golang
type ServerConn struct {
	Conn

	// If the succeeding authentication callback returned a
	// non-nil Permissions pointer, it is stored here.
	Permissions *Permissions
}
```

7、Session<br>
A Session represents a connection to a remote command or shell.
```golang
type Session struct {
	// Stdin specifies the remote process's standard input.
	// If Stdin is nil, the remote process reads from an empty
	// bytes.Buffer.
	Stdin io.Reader

	// Stdout and Stderr specify the remote process's standard
	// output and error.
	//
	// If either is nil, Run connects the corresponding file
	// descriptor to an instance of ioutil.Discard. There is a
	// fixed amount of buffering that is shared for the two streams.
	// If either blocks it may eventually cause the remote
	// command to block.
	Stdout io.Writer
	Stderr io.Writer
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

## 0x02 认证、配置相关

1、Signer<br>
A Signer can create signatures that verify against a public key.<br>

```golang
type Signer interface {
	// PublicKey returns an associated PublicKey instance.
	PublicKey() PublicKey

	// Sign returns raw signature for the given data. This method
	// will apply the hash specified for the keytype to the data.
	Sign(rand io.Reader, data []byte) (*Signature, error)
}
```

2、PublicKey<br>
PublicKey is an abstraction of different types of public keys.<br>

```golang
type PublicKey interface {
	// Type returns the key's type, e.g. "ssh-rsa".
	Type() string

	// Marshal returns the serialized key data in SSH wire format,
	// with the name prefix. To unmarshal the returned data, use
	// the ParsePublicKey function.
	Marshal() []byte

	// Verify that sig is a signature on the given data using this
	// key. This function will hash the data appropriately first.
	Verify(data []byte, sig *Signature) error
}
```

3、CertChecker<br>
CertChecker does the work of verifying a certificate. Its methods can be plugged into ClientConfig.HostKeyCallback and ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback. For the CertChecker to work, minimally, the IsAuthority callback should be set.

```golang
type CertChecker struct {
	// SupportedCriticalOptions lists the CriticalOptions that the
	// server application layer understands. These are only used
	// for user certificates.
	SupportedCriticalOptions []string

	// IsUserAuthority should return true if the key is recognized as an
	// authority for the given user certificate. This allows for
	// certificates to be signed by other certificates. This must be set
	// if this CertChecker will be checking user certificates.
	IsUserAuthority func(auth PublicKey) bool

	// IsHostAuthority should report whether the key is recognized as
	// an authority for this host. This allows for certificates to be
	// signed by other keys, and for those other keys to only be valid
	// signers for particular hostnames. This must be set if this
	// CertChecker will be checking host certificates.
	IsHostAuthority func(auth PublicKey, address string) bool

	// Clock is used for verifying time stamps. If nil, time.Now
	// is used.
	Clock func() time.Time

	// UserKeyFallback is called when CertChecker.Authenticate encounters a
	// public key that is not a certificate. It must implement validation
	// of user keys or else, if nil, all such keys are rejected.
	UserKeyFallback func(conn ConnMetadata, key PublicKey) (*Permissions, error)

	// HostKeyFallback is called when CertChecker.CheckHostKey encounters a
	// public key that is not a certificate. It must implement host key
	// validation or else, if nil, all such keys are rejected.
	HostKeyFallback HostKeyCallback

	// IsRevoked is called for each certificate so that revocation checking
	// can be implemented. It should return true if the given certificate
	// is revoked and false otherwise. If nil, no certificates are
	// considered to have been revoked.
	IsRevoked func(cert *Certificate) bool
}
```

4、ClientConfig<br>
A ClientConfig structure is used to configure a Client. It must not be modified after having been passed to an SSH function.<br>

```golang
type ClientConfig struct {
	// Config contains configuration that is shared between clients and
	// servers.
	Config

	// User contains the username to authenticate as.
	User string

	// Auth contains possible authentication methods to use with the
	// server. Only the first instance of a particular RFC 4252 method will
	// be used during authentication.
	Auth []AuthMethod

	// HostKeyCallback is called during the cryptographic
	// handshake to validate the server's host key. The client
	// configuration must supply this callback for the connection
	// to succeed. The functions InsecureIgnoreHostKey or
	// FixedHostKey can be used for simplistic host key checks.
	HostKeyCallback HostKeyCallback

	// BannerCallback is called during the SSH dance to display a custom
	// server's message. The client configuration can supply this callback to
	// handle it as wished. The function BannerDisplayStderr can be used for
	// simplistic display on Stderr.
	BannerCallback BannerCallback

	// ClientVersion contains the version identification string that will
	// be used for the connection. If empty, a reasonable default is used.
	ClientVersion string

	// HostKeyAlgorithms lists the key types that the client will
	// accept from the server as host key, in order of
	// preference. If empty, a reasonable default is used. Any
	// string returned from PublicKey.Type method may be used, or
	// any of the CertAlgoXxxx and KeyAlgoXxxx constants.
	HostKeyAlgorithms []string

	// Timeout is the maximum amount of time for the TCP connection to establish.
	//
	// A Timeout of zero means no timeout.
	Timeout time.Duration
}
```

5、ServerConfig<br>
ServerConfig holds server specific configuration data.<br>

```golang
type ServerConfig struct {
	// Config contains configuration shared between client and server.
	Config

	// NoClientAuth is true if clients are allowed to connect without
	// authenticating.
	NoClientAuth bool

	// MaxAuthTries specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts
	// permitted per connection. If set to a negative number, the number of
	// attempts are unlimited. If set to zero, the number of attempts are limited
	// to 6.
	MaxAuthTries int

	// PasswordCallback, if non-nil, is called when a user
	// attempts to authenticate using a password.
	PasswordCallback func(conn ConnMetadata, password []byte) (*Permissions, error)

	// PublicKeyCallback, if non-nil, is called when a client
	// offers a public key for authentication. It must return a nil error
	// if the given public key can be used to authenticate the
	// given user. For example, see CertChecker.Authenticate. A
	// call to this function does not guarantee that the key
	// offered is in fact used to authenticate. To record any data
	// depending on the public key, store it inside a
	// Permissions.Extensions entry.
	PublicKeyCallback func(conn ConnMetadata, key PublicKey) (*Permissions, error)

	// KeyboardInteractiveCallback, if non-nil, is called when
	// keyboard-interactive authentication is selected (RFC
	// 4256). The client object's Challenge function should be
	// used to query the user. The callback may offer multiple
	// Challenge rounds. To avoid information leaks, the client
	// should be presented a challenge even if the user is
	// unknown.
	KeyboardInteractiveCallback func(conn ConnMetadata, client KeyboardInteractiveChallenge) (*Permissions, error)

	// AuthLogCallback, if non-nil, is called to log all authentication
	// attempts.
	AuthLogCallback func(conn ConnMetadata, method string, err error)

	// ServerVersion is the version identification string to announce in
	// the public handshake.
	// If empty, a reasonable default is used.
	// Note that RFC 4253 section 4.2 requires that this string start with
	// "SSH-2.0-".
	ServerVersion string

	// BannerCallback, if present, is called and the return string is sent to
	// the client after key exchange completed but before authentication.
	BannerCallback func(conn ConnMetadata) string

	// GSSAPIWithMICConfig includes gssapi server and callback, which if both non-nil, is used
	// when gssapi-with-mic authentication is selected (RFC 4462 section 3).
	GSSAPIWithMICConfig *GSSAPIWithMICConfig
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```
